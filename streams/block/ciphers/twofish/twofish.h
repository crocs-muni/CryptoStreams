    /**
    Convert a cipher key to the internal form used for
    encryption and decryption.

    The cipher key is an array of bytes; the Twofish_Byte type is
    defined above to a type suitable on your platform.

    Any key must be converted to an internal form in the TwoFishKey structure
    before it can be used.
    The encryption and decryption functions only work with the internal form.
    The conversion to internal form need only be done once for each key value.

    Be sure to wipe all key storage, including the TwoFishKey structure,
    once you are done with the key data.
    A call to TwofishKey::Clear() will do just fine.

    Unlike most implementations, this one allows any key size from 0 bytes
    to 32 bytes. According to the Twofish specifications,
    irregular key sizes are handled by padding the key with zeroes at the end
    until the key size is 16, 24, or 32 bytes, whichever
    comes first. Note that each key of irregular size is equivalent to exactly
    one key of 16, 24, or 32 bytes.

    WARNING: Short keys have low entropy, and result in low security.
    Anything less than 8 bytes is utterly insecure. For good security
    use at least 16 bytes. I prefer to use 32-byte keys to prevent
    any collision attacks on the key.

    The key length argument key_len must be in the proper range.
    If key_len is not in the range 0,...,32 this routine attempts to generate
    a fatal error (depending on the code environment),
    and at best (or worst) returns without having done anything.

    Arguments:
    aKeyBytes   Array of key bytes
    aKeyLength  Number of key bytes, must be in the range 0,1,...,32.
    aKey        Pointer to a TwofishKey object that will be filled
                with the internal form of the cipher key.
